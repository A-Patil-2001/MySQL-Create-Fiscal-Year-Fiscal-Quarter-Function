# MySQL-Create-Fiscal-Year-Fiscal-Quarter-Function
In this project, **MySQL user-defined functions** are built to transform **calendar dates** into **Fiscal Years** and **Fiscal Quarters** for financial and business analytics.

-  **Why Do We Use This?**
Businesses do not analyze performance based on the **January–December calendar year**.
Instead, financial reporting follows a **Fiscal Year (September-August)** and **Fiscal Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)** because this aligns with budgeting, taxation, and strategic planning.

To simplify this, we can create MySQL functions that return fiscal year and fiscal quarter directly from any date.
